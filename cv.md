## Work Experience

### BlueJeans Networks, Bangalore 
Senior Software Developer, Core Platform Team   
May 2015 - Jul 2017   

#### Next Generation Platform  
##### Technologies Used: Java, NodeJS, SpringBoot, Hystrix, Ribbon, OkHttp, NGINX, Feign, Graphana, Docker, Wowza Streaming Engine, AWS DynamoDB
  * Re-engineered the application design to enable a pure micro-service architecture  
  * Refactored the existing monolithic backend codebase to facilitate deployments as microservices, involving migration of the Google Guice based framework to Spring Boot
  * Migrated the existing technology stack to Amazon Web Services Cloud.   
  * Using Infrastructure-as-Code, the system can now be re-instantiated in any AWS data center    
  * The improved performance, scalability and reliability resulted in an increase in the Monthly Uptime Percentage from .99 to .9999  
  * System capacity increased from 5k users to 45k  
  * System load limit increased from 500 API requests/sec to 100k requests/secs
